This is an affective model for studying. Duoling employs a similar method. of course it needs to randomized a bit more. I may have taken a swing at it if it wasn't for the instructional mix-ups. I also had a tutor that tried but 
didn't help. I need to work with people consistently to communicate adiquately with them.. but eventually I know 
my coworkers better than they know themselves because of my coping strategies (APD). New tutors every week for various reasons makes it rough. 

When using: select the answers when prompted. enter initials when prompted.
